# Introduction
The purpose of this project is to create a Raspberry Pi image preconfigured with n8n so that it runs out of the box.

## What is n8n?
[n8n](https://n8n.io) is a no-code/low code environment used to connect and automate different systems and services. It is programmed using a series of connected nodes that receive, transform, and then transmit date from and to other nodes. Each node represents a service or system allowing these different entities to interact. All of this is done using a WebUI.

## Why n8n-pi?
Whevever a new technology is released, two common barriers often prevent potential users from trying out the technology:
1. System costs
1. Installation & configuration challenges

The n8n-pi project eliminates these two roadblocks by preconfiguring a working system that runs on easily available, low cost hardware. For as little as $40 and a few minutes, they can have a full n8n system up and running.
