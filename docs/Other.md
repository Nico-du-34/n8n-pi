## Automated Image Builder (AIB)
Whenever there is a new version of n8n released or an update to the n8n-pi system, a number of actions need to happen in order to make sure that all of the updates find themselves in the new image, the images get created and distributes, the proper documentation is created, and that the updates get annouced to the world.

Days, weeks, or months can go by before I find the time to go through this whole process and get the updated version of n8n-pi to the world.

The purpose of this project is to create a process that will automatically detect, build, document and distribute new images with little (or no) interaction required.
