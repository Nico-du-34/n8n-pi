# What is n8n-pi?
n8n-pi is a port of the amazing [n8n](https://n8n.io) automation system to the Raspberry Pi environment.

# What is n8n?
[n8n](https://n8n.io) is a no-code/low code environment used to connect and automate different systems and services. It is programmed using a series of connected nodes that receive, transform, and then transmit date from and to other nodes. Each node represents a service or system allowing these different entities to interact. All of this is done using a WebUI.

# Why n8n-pi?
Whevever a new technology is released, two common barriers often prevent potential users from trying out the technology:
1. System costs
1. Installation & configuration challenges

The n8n-pi project eliminates these two roadblocks by preconfiguring a working system that runs on easily available, low cost hardware. For as little as $40 and a few minutes, they can have a full n8n system up and running.

# What's with the Robots?
I am a very visual person. Images and pictures tend to hold more meaning to me than text and words. I associate memories and concepts better when I see an graphic than a name.

This is where the robots come in. Each project that I have has a unique robot associated with it. So, when I see a specific robot, I immediately know which project we are talking about. This helps me to remember all the different aspects of the project quickly.

If you are interested in creating your own robot (or monster or kitten or human), visit [RoboHash](https://robohash.org/) to build your own. Or, better yet, you can host your own robotic factory with the blueprints from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/e1ven/Robohash).
