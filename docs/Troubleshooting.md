# Raspberry Pi
## Raspberry Pi does not boot after copying image file to microSD card
### **Challenge**
After the image file is copied to the microSD card and the card is put into the Raspberry Pi, the Raspberry Pi will not boot when turned on.
### **Potential Problem**
The image file is not copied to the microSD card like you would copy a normal file to a flash drive. The image file needs to be written to the microSD card.
### **Resolution**
Write the image file to the microSD card using a program such as [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/). This will properly prep the microSD card to boot the Raspberry Pi.
